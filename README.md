##### features

+ This plug-in is based on crawler index content from TPBac or TPBac mirror, not the content provided or produced by this plug-in.
+ In the plugin settings, you can customize the TPBac domain name for yourself by setting the plugin login account. Otherwise, the system will attempt to automatically obtain it. If the automatic acquisition also fails, a default TPBac mirror domain name will be used.

###### About the settings in this plugin:

    * login user: it will be used as an alternative TPBac mirror domain, For example: https://www.TPBac.com (Do not add / at the end).
    * login pass: It doesn't make any sense. You can fill it out casually.


#### About TPBac

> You must know that TPBac's global domain name and image are unstable, and your best approach is to set the username (mapped to TPBac) through the plugin instead of letting the plugin help you find a suitable TPBac.
